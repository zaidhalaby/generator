### Your group's development plan which should include milestones, individual tasks, and who is responsible for those tasks:
#### Our group split up work among us three. I worked on getting an input and creating the if statements. Hamza created the formatting for the outputs and all of the dictionaries while Jad worked on getting all of the information for the dictionaries and assisted me and Hamza as well. Our milestone is now being able to get multiple songs and a working code but our final goal is a GUI and the ability to have one song recommended rather than all the applicable songs. Moving forward we will decide our responsibilities.

### Description of the program's purpose (why does it exist and/or who is it for?)
#### It exists because we all know the common issue of taking ages to choose a song or movie based on your mood. That is why we created this code, which can be used by most people ages 10+.
### Summary of the program's functionality (what does it do?)
#### It takes a user input based on the question â€œSong or Movie '', and then another input that answers the style of your music/genre of movie.  After this, you get another question indicating mood then the code then runs through the dictionaries and filters by that mood and genre and gives you a song or movie that we put in and pre-categorized. 
### A description, with code segments, of a "breakthrough moment" in which you solved a particularly difficult problem, learned to do something new, or independently overcame being stuck:
#### Our breakthrough moment was when we were able to filter down the movie code  and filter songs as it was tough and it took us the most time. This was a group challenge that we all worked on overcoming.
#### filtered_songs = [song for song in longarrays if song["genre"] == user_genre] 
#### This code takes a song from the longarrays and defines it as a song that fits the genre that is the same as the user genre/input. It stores it as filtered_songs.
